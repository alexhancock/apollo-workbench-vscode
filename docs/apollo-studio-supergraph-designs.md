# Designing a change to an existing graph in Apollo Studio

While logged into Apollo Studio, you have the ability to create a workbench from an existing graph. Just right click on the graph you want and Workbench will create a local copy of all the services in that graph (if it's a monolith, a monolith service will be added into the workbench with your schema).
